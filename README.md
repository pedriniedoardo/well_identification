# well_identification
the ImageJ macro allow to crop an image in correspondence of a well in a 96 well-plate, no matter where the well is place in the whole image (is not necessary for the well to be placed in the middle). 
The macro works with BF images. In case of fluo images I also record the BF toachieve the cropping.
